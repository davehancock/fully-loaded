# fully-loaded


A trivial example demonstrating some containerized consumer applications under load.
 
The example makes use of the following:

    - Docker 1.12 with native Swarm mode, built in load balancing, routing mesh etc
    - Docker compose + Distributed Application Bundle file usage
    - Gatling load testing tool
    - Some simple Java 8 Spring boot apps

See the below diagram for a basic overview.
